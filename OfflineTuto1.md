## **Notes**

* There is no attendance requirement. And recording will be available after the tutorial. ^_^
* If you have trouble setting up the environment, this is a good chance to seek help as there will be senior members available on the spot and you can ask for their help directly.
* The offline tutorial serves as a review and supplement to the online videos. Details please see `Outline`.
* Because we do have some students who are already familiar with C/C++ programming but unfamiliar with the usage of git, I will try to cover the Git part first and then move on to the C++ part so that people who are already familiar with C/C++ programming may leave early or they may feel bored.
